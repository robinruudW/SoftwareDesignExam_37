Hello Welcome to my application. This is a small application that I have created to demonstrate what i have learned in Software Design curriculum.
How to run the application:
either open the snl file provided in the zip in visual studio or clone the repository from https://github.com/robinruudW/SoftwareDesignExam_37 and open it in visual studio.
Before you start the application, you Need to go into MovieDatabaseContext.cs and change the dbpath too where movies.db is located on your computer. i have tried to debug this issue
with no luck. 

Then you can run the application either through the green play button or opening a terminal and writing dotnet clean, the dotnet build then dotnet run.
after that you will be greeted with a menu where you can choose between 3 options. movie menu where you can add, delete, update , list movies or rate a movie. or exit. same for showmenu
or exit the application
the application is very intuative and simple. 

to run tests you can either run the tests in visual studio or open a terminal and write dotnet test. all 6 tests should pass.
